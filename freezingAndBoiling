# QUESTION NUM 20:
# STATEMENT:The following table lists the freezing and boiling points of several substances. Write a program that asks the user to enter a
# temperature, and then shows all the substances that will freeze at that temperature and all that will boil at that temperature. For
# example, if the user enters -20 the program should report that water will freeze and oxygen will boil at that temperature.

temperature=int(input("ENTER TEMPERATURE: \n"))
if temperature <= -173:
    print("Ethyl Alchol Will Be Freezing at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature <= -38:
    print("Mercury Will Be Freezing at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature <= -362:
    print("Oxygen Will be freezing at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature <= 32:
    print("Water Will be freezing at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature >=172:
     print("Ethyl Alchol Will Be Boiling at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature>=676:
    print("Mercury Will Be Boiling  at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature>=-306:
    print("Oxygen Will be Boiling at this temperature.",end='\n')
if temperature>=212:
    print("Water Will be freezing at this temperature.",end='\n')
